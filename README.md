# YOYO-PIZZA
Task: Build a pizza ordering bot for YoYo Pizza!
Build a chatbot which can help users with the Pizza Ordering. Imagine what the user flow would look like in an actual store; All the orders generated on the Bot should get stored in a database.

I have used a python programming language to make chatbot but due to some reason I am unable to deploy it into a server but my code is absolutely correct. 
I have used Anaconda prompt in which I have used RASA and trained it for NLU then I have done this, so I can say my code is fully working.
